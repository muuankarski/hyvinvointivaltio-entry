Stratification and Sustainability in Different Worlds of Welfare 
[abstract: 153 words; main text, including title, table, authors and references = 6 774 words; plus 6 figures]
Abstract
On the footsteps of ‘The Three Worlds’, we analyse current challenges for old and new welfare regimes in terms of stratification and sustainability. This brings the interplay between employment and the welfare state into focus. First we analyse transitions from school to work, then we examine labour market participation rates of mothers, and finally we have a look at the exit patterns among the pre-retirement elderly. Among the current ‘Worlds of Welfare’, our results show remarkable regime differences in how countries are able to deal with stratification and sustainability over the economic life cycle. Is this a consequence of an inescapable trade-off between stratification and sustainability where policy design is a result of different political preferences? We argue against that and suggest that a ‘variable approach’ could be used for unlocking the ‘regime approach’ in the analysis of welfare state entry-exit patterns and for informing about a new policy agenda for ageing societies.  
Introduction
Without doubt, one of the most influential books in the field of welfare state studies is The Three World of Welfare Capitalism by Gøsta Esping-Andersen (GEA).  The book caused an avalanche of debates on welfare regimes. Much has changed during the quarter century the book was publicised. Re-visiting The Three Worlds is an interesting exercise. It remains an inspiring treatise on some of the most important issues in political economy of our time. By using concepts such as decommodification, the public-private mix and the social wage, GEA elaborated an analysis of welfare state institutions that was both dynamic and theoretically driven. He then observed how the institutional configurations not only conditioned peoples’ behaviours but also shaped inequalities in society.  The stratification processes he identified clustered countries in a way that made it possible to talk about three worlds of welfare capitalism. We argue that it is the identification of these processes, rather than the particular clustering of nations at the time, which in retrospect is the most profound contribution of the book. What we see as an equally important - but less elaborated and recognised - theme in the book is related to the concept of sustainability, an issue to which GEA has returned in later publications (e.g. Esping-Andersen et al 2002).
The aim of our contribution is to support these claims by exploring what we see as a very promising avenue offered by The Three Worlds: the analysis of the various risks that individuals meet over their life cycles. GEA’s perspective is here integrated with an understanding of how the transformations of employment among the most advanced industrial nations were interlinked in different ways with the welfare state regimes. The focus is on the entry and exit patterns on the labour market where the state, family and market intersect and interact. The process is intimately related to the silent revolutions (Esping-Andersen 1999, 2002, 2009) on post-industrial labour markets, where female labour market participation, service employment and new entry/exit patterns challenge the prevailing welfare regimes. This brings us to examine what we see as the two fundamental themes of The Three Worlds, namely stratification and sustainability, and how they may interact. In this paper, we analyse these themes by exploring new kinds of data for the post-1990 worlds of welfare capitalism.
Whereas ‘the bigger, the better’ was an underlying theme in The Three Worlds, the solvency of public finances is on the fore in recent debates, and policy-makers seek for approaches for the welfare state to meet new challenges. It is not our purpose to give a fully-fledged in-depth analysis on some specific theme in The Three Worlds, rather we want to discuss some recent policy discourses that are important for understanding the challenges for the present-day welfare state. Each of the themes we touch upon is a major subject in literature already and complex enough for a production of a huge pile of papers. In our contribution, rather than analysing one specific aspect in detail, we try to sketch the dimensions GEA partly lost on the way from WZB Social Science Research Centre in Berlin to the European University Institute in Florence in the second half of the 1980s, as he completed The Three Worlds. It is an analysis of life-course transitions in different welfare states. The theme has later been worked on by other scholars, notably by Karl Ulrich Mayer (2004). 
We start by looking at demographic challenges for the solvency of the welfare state and cursorily discuss the concept of sustainability deficit to describe the severity of fiscal challenges in different countries. Sustainability deficit is looked at from two different angles: from population projections extending to the 2050s and from the concept of life-cycle deficits (LCD). The LCD approach highlights the interplay between employment and the welfare state; entry and exit in both domains. After that, we first analyse transitions from school to work to see how different regimes manage to facilitate that transition. Then follows a longer section, where the labour market participation patterns of mothers are examined. The last empirical section looks at the exit patterns of the older component of the labour force and stratification risks associated with that phase in the life cycle. In the final section, we discuss our findings in more general terms. 
Data and new worlds    
In the 1980s, there was really very little systematic data available about the Southern European countries, Asia and Latin America, not to speak about the former socialist hemisphere. This is now changing. As a consequence, the number of identified welfare regimes has increased (see e.g. Aidukaite 2004; Gough 2004; Castles & al. 2012; Scruggs & al. 2014). The data being produced appear to be bifurcating: OECD has expanded its scope to new countries, among them countries of Southern Europe, former Socialist countries, Mexico and South Korea. Eurostat produces deeper and more extensive information on the EU-countries (which have more doubled in numbers since 1990). In addition to macro-level data, Eurostat also releases individual-level data (the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions – longitudinal micro-data, EU SILC, Eurostat 2013a). The flip-side is that the extensive EU-data excludes non-European countries that were constitutive parts of GEA’s liberal regime.  We have chosen to analyse data that represent the early 1980s, i.e. the same time point that GEA used in his Three Worlds, and then contrast it with data of the period from 2005 to 2010.  Despite improved access to data, we had to restrict some of our analyses to a few countries.
 The emphasis on the life cycle in the subsequent analysis is to be understood against the backdrop of general solvency problems of the European welfare state (see below).  Here the concept of life cycle deficits (LCD), which has been developed in the context of the National Transfer Accounts (NTA; see  http://www.ntaccounts.org/web/nta/show) project, is a useful tool for bridging the analysis between the macro and micro levels.
In the following, we have, when permitted by the data, ‘expanded’ the number of worlds of welfare to five: the Nordic (consisting of Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden); Continental European (Austria, Belgium, Germany, France, the Netherlands and Switzerland); Anglo-liberal (Ireland and the UK; in some graphs (Figure 5) we also depict the Australian (AUS) and the United States (US) developmental patterns); Southern European (Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain); and Post-Socialist (the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia) welfare regimes (e.g. Castles & al. 2012). Depending on the availability of data, the number of countries in each regime may vary. Unfortunately, the LCD figures are so far available only for a handful of countries.
This paper's methodology is exploratory. By describing the development of some key variables that capture stratification and sustainability over the life course, we can identify patterns with regard to ‘goal-performance’ of different institutional regimes.  
Challenges for the welfare state: sustainability and stratification deficits
In The Three Worlds, population change was not the main issue. However, when expenditure levels continued to increase in the 1990, the discussion about new challenges due to the greying population and problematic dependency ratios got a prominent position in the discourse on the future of the welfare state (e.g. Blossfeld, Bucholz & Kurz 2011; Park 2011; European Commission 2012a; Vanhuysse & Gorres 2012; OECD 2013).
The projected increase of the share of elderly in general population will increase demands for income transfers and social and health services. There are a number of indicators aimed at evaluating the fiscal pressures that the population change will generate. One such a measure is the ‘sustainability deficit’, a device used by the European Commission (e.g. 2009 and 2012) to inspect future needs for structural adjustments of public finances in the EU Member States.  The concept of ‘sustainability deficit’ – or fiscal gap – pertains to the ability of a welfare state to maintain its current programs, spending levels and taxes in the decades to come. On the basis of these estimates, it is possible to judge what the needs are for immediate and long-term tax increases, or benefit cuts, for maintaining government solvency. The size of the adjustments is expressed as a percentage of the GDP. Despite all the uncertainties linked to such long-term prognoses, they give hints about the magnitude of reforms required to reconcile projected revenues with expenditures. Sustainability deficits in Europe vary from the low Hungarian (0.4%), German (1.4%), French (1.6%) and Swedish (1.7%) figures to close to 10% in Belgium. The severity of problems does not follow a clear regime-related pattern: the deficits among the smallest and largest can be found in some former East-European countries (Hungary 0.5% vs. Slovenia 7.6%; coefficient of variation (CV) among the regime = .93), the same goes for the Central European (Germany vs. Belgium; CV = .64) and Nordic (Sweden vs. Finland 5.8%; CV = .62) clusters. The Liberal regime with high deficit rates (mean = 5.9%) is rather homogenous (CV = .16).  (European Commission 2012b, 78).
Cross-sectional projections are one way of looking at the sustainability problems, but they are too static. A more dynamic approach is offered by the LCD analysis. LCD measures economic flows across age groups by summarising how each age group produces, consumes, transfers and saves resources over the life cycle. Flows between age groups are pertinent to the human lifecycle: children and the elderly consume more than they produce.  The flows take place via private transfers and public governmental programs. Deficit is quantified by subtracting the value of consumption from the value of production in each age group. The age-related value and size of transfer flows in relation to value of production produce a positive LCD during the dependent years and negative during the working years (Lee & Mason 2011; Riihelä & al. 2011; Lind 2012).
An LCD inspection tentatively reveals regime-specific peculiarities (which were also pinpointed by GEA). As a rule, in Continental-Europe, the youngsters enter earlier into the labour markets than e.g. in the Nordic cluster, but in contrast, the older workers there have earlier exit from employment. The specific problem for many Post-Socialist countries is the late entry into and the early exit from labour markets. The Nordic countries display high deficit values for the very young, indicating heavy investments in child care facilities, and for the very old, indicating costly old-age care arrangements. (http://ntaccounts.org/web/nta/show/Country%20Summaries). 
Figure 1. Life Cycle Deficit in some EU countries. 
  

While the less desirable side of public social care consists of extensive public expenditure on required facilities and hence, high tax rates, the more welcome side of heavy investments in public services is high female employment rates, which combats sustainability deficit of the welfare state.  It has been calculated that an increase of one percentage point in the employment rate would decrease the sustainability deficit by 0.7 percent (European Commission 2009). Thus, the level of employment is an important factor for the solvency of the welfare state. Indeed, high employment rates are the corner-stone of the renowned Scandinavian welfare state model (Kvist & al. 2012). Whereas employment problems in the Nordic countries are associated with the youth phase, the issue in Central and Southern Europe is the (too) early exit from the labour markets. In addition, low female labour-force participation hampers the value of production in these countries – which is a challenge for the East-Asia, too. What we argue is that this focus is helpful in terms of identifying policy designs that are relevant for combating both the stratification (class and gender) and sustainability deficits. 
The transition from education to employment
There are substantial variations in national educational systems, and these differences have important ramifications for the school-leaving age and for the form and duration of the school-to-work transition (Boudon 1974; Shavit & Müller 1998; Müller & Gangl 2003; OECD 2010a; Brzinsky-Fay 2011). As displayed in Figure 2, there is a general trend that girls leave school later than boys (mean school-leaving ages are 19.3 and 18.1 years, respectively), but the other side of the coin is that the transition to work takes place faster among females than males (1.3 vs. 2.2 years). The gender difference in the duration is partially explained by the compulsory military service for males in a number of EU-countries (Austria, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Norway and Switzerland). The late exit from school and relatively rapid entry into the labour markets is characteristic to Continental Europe. The phenomenon is related to the dual educational system, combining work and studies for non-university students and integrating the students into working life through apprenticeships (e.g. in Austria, Germany and Switzerland; see OECD 2000; Brzinsky-Fay 2011). 
 Figure 2. School-leaving age and duration of transition from school to employment. 
 
(Source: OECD 2008: 72)
A complementary way of inspecting the transition from education to employment is to look at the employment situation of those who have finished their final education.  Figure 3 depicts employment rates for males and females who have taken their exams one and five years ago, respectively. When it comes to those who have graduated a year ago, the gender gap is negligible. It is only in Southern European countries (notably so in Greece, Spain and Italy) where there a visible gender divide. Employment rates in the other countries and under other regimes are relatively gender neutral, but there are marked differences between countries: the overall employment rates vary from the very low 50 percent in Greece to 80 percent in the Netherlands and Switzerland.
While gender is not an important divide in employment one year after the graduation, impacts of various social institutions creating gender differences in family responsibilities and possibilities for employment become clearer the longer the time elapsed since graduation (Esping-Andersen 2009). After five years, gender differences are substantial and regime differences are clearly visible. Under the Post-Socialist and Southern-European regimes and to some extent also in France, Belgium and Germany, women have problems in combining child-rearing and employment which, in turn, results in giving up employment or in very low fertility rates. Differences are smaller in the Nordic countries, Switzerland, the Netherlands and the UK. Thus, the gender divide follows, but not completely, the regime lines. 
Figure3. Employment rates (%) by gender (left-hand panel) and educational attainment (right-hand panel) 1 year and 5 years after finishing education. 
 
(Source: OECD 2008: 39-40)

In addition to gender, educational attainment creates obstacles and sorts youngsters into different positions, as shown in the right-hand panel in Figure 3.  Youngsters without upper secondary education have significantly more problems in entering into the labour markets than better educated. On average, less that 50 percent of the youth with low educational attainment were without a job one year after finishing the school. The situation is the worst in Southern Europe (Greece and Italy, in particular) and the Post-Socialist (Hungary and Poland) countries. The ‘stratification deficit’ is a common problem among regimes but the magnitude of the problems differs (Allmendinger 1989; Åberg 2003; Gesthuizen & al. (2011); Schröder & Ganzeboom 2014). 
After five years, the situation is better: employment rates are higher after five years than after one year of graduation, but there still are substantial differences between low and high-skilled. Differences are the smallest in Sweden and in the Netherlands. In some cases (Austria and France), employment rates among highly-skilled are lower after five years than they were after one year – something that is related to children and other family responsibilities. 
Education is a social investment and likely to be the most important stratification mechanism in the developed world. In 2011, almost half of the 15 – 29 year age group participated in education and close to 40 percent were already employed. There was a group of young persons (10 – 20 percent of the age group) who were involved neither in employment, nor education or training, the NEETs. (see e.g. http://www.oecd.org/education/skills-beyond-school/EDIF%202013--N%C2%B013%20%28eng%29--FINAL.pdf)  Although we can also here trace country-related variation, there are clear welfare-regime-related patterns.  The NEET problem is the smallest under the Nordic and Continental European regimes (5% unemployed and 6 percent inactive). On the other end of the continuum, we have the Southern European regime with a NEET-rate of 22 percent (13 % unemployed and 9% inactive). The Liberal (16% for the UK and 22% for Ireland) and the Post-Socialist (16%) regimes are between these extremes (see also ILO 2013: 90). The social gradient in the NEET-rates is an apparent and obvious example where stratification and sustainability deficits intersect.   
Economic crises and growing unemployment have made it difficult, in particular for those with low educational attainment, to find jobs. The best results are achieved in countries that combine school and work through various kinds of apprenticeship programs. The question mark here is related to the pattern of early retirement in countries with these kinds of educational regimes. If Lundvall and Lorentz (2012) are right about universally open and equal education and training systems (that do not create dead ends), in combination with flexible labour market institutions, producing the best results in terms of activity rates – whether we deal with young, mature or older labour force – then the policy makers in all regimes should reconsider the design of education and production regimes. At least if they want to create the ‘best of all worlds’ where stratification and sustainability deficits are reduced simultaneously.
Employment of mothers 
One of the main criticisms against The Three Worlds was that the book was gender blind. It was argued that the construction of the decommodification index was based on male production worker and failed to describe the situation among women. As a response to the criticism, GEA published a number of less ‘gender-blind’ books (e.g. 1999; 2001 and 2009). As the discussion on life cycle deficits showed, for the sustainability of the public finances it is important to increase employment rates not only in the beginning and in the end of work career, but it is also important to increase labour-force participation rates in the middle of the work career of both men and women. Thus, it is decisive how easy it is to unify work and family (see e.g. Leira 2002; Gornick & Meyers 2005 and 2009; Mandel & Semyenov 2006; Prince Cooke 2011; Hobson 2013). The work-family relationship affects the solvency of welfare state in two ways. First, fertility rate has its impact upon a stable demographic structure and old-age dependency ratio. As GEA (2009) puts it, good family policy is the best pension policy. In the developed world, there are substantial differences in fertility: whereas fertility rates are the highest under the Nordic and Liberal regimes (close to 2), they are somewhat lower in Central Europe (1.7), much lower in Southern Europe (1.3) and in East-Asia (Japan 1.4 and Korea 1.3; or close to 1 in Hong Kong and Macau (World Bank 2013). 
Second, for solving the sustainability deficits, tax bases have to be as wide as possible, which implies increasing both male and female employment. When it comes to the overall female employment rates, there is still a more or less clear divide between the regimes. Regime-based differences in employment prevail, although the within- and the between-regime dispersion has diminished. Regime differences have narrowed, but regimes have become more consistent.  In 1985, the difference between the high Nordic mean (75 percent) and the low Southern European mean (44 percent) was as much as 31 percentage points, while by 2010 it was only 14 percentage points (OECD 2012).
Since the mid-1980s the gender gap in employment has diminished.  Whereas three decades ago the gap in employment was 12 percentage points in the Nordic countries, the difference was down to 6 percentage points by 2010. The corresponding percentage point gaps were 26 and 10 for Central Europe, 29 and 13 for the Anglo-liberal countries, and 36 and 17 for South Europe. The gender employment gap in the Post-Socialist block was 17 percentage points in 2010. (OECD 1982; 1992; and 2012). Since the early 1990, participation rates have gone down, and by now the female economic activity in the Post-Socialist countries is as low as in the traditional male-breadwinner countries.
A clear converging trend can be seen also in age-specific labour-force participation rates among women. The previous M-shaped (prevalent in the Central-European, Liberal and also East Asian regimes) and the sharply peaked (in South Europe) employment patterns are converging towards the upside-down U-formation, typical for the Nordic model. Traditionally, having children in Southern Europe led to giving up employment (Esping-Andersen 2009; Mandel & Shalev 2008 and 2009), which is reflected in the peak employment figures for females in the 20-24-years age bracket, whereafter, in later age groups, the employment rates for them sharply diminish (‘South E’ in the left-hand panel). The M-curve for the Anglo-liberal regime indicates that women with family responsibilities are outside the labour force, but once their children have grown up, they re-enter employment (see e.g. Stier & Lewin-Epstein 2001). 
Figure 4. Female labour-force participation rates (%) according to age under different welfare state regimes. 

 Sources: OECD 1992; OECD 2010; OECD 2013a
An alternative way to look at the impact of motherhood upon employment is to compare employment among women without children and women with children. Whereas in Scandinavia this difference – or motherhood penalty – is negligible, under the other regimes the penalty is substantial. In the Czech Republic and Hungary, the motherhood penalty is over 30 percentage points, and in the UK and Germany it reaches 20 percentage points (http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/pdf/themes/31_labour_market_participation_of_women.pdf; OECD 2013b;  Esping-Andersen 2009: 84-85). 
The Three Worlds paid attention to the gendered stratification effect the welfare states have, but the book did not analyse the duration of family-related absences from the paid labour.  The EU SILC compilation provides us with data to carry out comparisons on longitudinal micro-data and to show to what extent welfare regimes display differences in motherhood-related absences from the labour market (Figure 5). 
Figure 5. Duration of maternity-related absences from the labour market. 
Source: The authors' own calculations based on the EU-SILC micro-data.

As can be seen, Scandinavian mothers return to employment fairly soon, while child birth under the Post Socialist regime seems to lead to longer absences. A bit surprisingly, Southern European mothers are employed faster than their Continental European counterparts. Partially this is explained by higher fertility rates (1.7 in Central Europe vs. 1.4 in the Southern Europe), which is associated with multiple births and hence, longer absences. Furthermore, in some Continental European countries (e.g. in Austria) there are possibilities to prolong the parental leave to look after a child up to three years of age. These examples fortify the strong gender-based stratification effect the welfare state institutions have in entry-exit patterns (Esping-Andersen 1999; 2001 and 2009; Korpi 2000; Mandel 2012).
In the family policy area, there is a kind of ongoing dual process, which is strongly regime-biased (e.g. Ellingsæter & Leira 2006; Ferrarini 2006; Lewis 2012). On one hand, female labour-force rates are high under the Nordic regime but, on the other hand, fathers have their specific paternity-leave schemes and daddy quotas leading to more gender-neutral division of family responsibilities. In Scandinavia, mothers are liberated to work, and fathers are liberated to take on care-responsibilities at home. However, this is apparently an unfinished revolution. As long as the parental leave schemes are not designed as individual rights, it appears unlikely that the remaining gender differences will disappear not only in entry-exit patterns on the labour market but also in pay gap and career opportunities. These gaps continue to exhibit gender deficits, which goes in an opposite direction to the superior performance of women at all levels of the education systems in so many of the most advanced industrial nations. This suggests that policy makers should think outside the box of the current institutional design if they want to simultaneously reduce the stratification and sustainability deficits.
Labour market exit: stratification and sustainability
In The Three Worlds, GEA takes up the issue of early exit from the labour market of ‘older’ workers (notably pp. 150 ff.). He observes the common trend of decreasing (male) participation across regimes but points to the very large variation between regimes (along the common downward trend). He then challenges the two dominant views in the research that has focused either on benefit generosity of the pension systems or on unemployment levels to explain the variation in time and space and instead suggests that the most important source for the cross-national variation is to be found in the interaction between high unemployment and generous benefits. This is why the Continental European countries show very high exit rates, whereas the equally generous Nordic countries do not. 
While GEA’s analysis has some elegance, it is fair to say that it is brief and suggestive rather than confirmatory. Moreover, he does not elaborate much either on the stratification or on the sustainability themes of the exit patterns, which, after all, constitute a fundamental change for the employment regimes.
Now the world is changing again. Since 1990, the trend towards earlier exit has been broken in many countries. Another of the silent revolutions identified by GEA is feeding into this: the increased female labour-force participation. Figure 6 provides data for a small number of countries, but they illustrate that the new trends are affecting countries in all ‘worlds’ of capitalism. Sweden has maintained the highest overall participation rates during the entire period, with no real decline for the total labour force, but if it had not been for the increased female participation rate it would have dipped until the mid-1990s. The UK and the USA both see recovering participation rates for men and an increasing trend for women during the latter part of the period. The increased participation rates for Germany are remarkable, but also in France we see an increase for the recent period, albeit from lower levels.
Figure 6. Employment participation rates of elderly (60 to 64 years of age) workers in some OECD countries. 

(Source: OECD 1992; 2010b and 2012)
This is also related to some of the concluding remarks that GEA makes in the last chapter of the book. The Achilles’ heel of the Swedish model is the tax ceilings to be met by a model that is maintaining full employment by largely relying on part-time female public employment. What he is underestimating is the magnitude of the silent revolution:  to an increasing degree, women are working the same hours as men, and that will have consequences for the tax base.  The common trend towards increased labour force participation will satisfy the ambition to decrease the sustainability deficit. What about the stratification deficit? On the basis of the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS), we calculated the poverty rates for the 55-64 age group, with 50% of the median income for the entire population used as the poverty line. It is worth pointing to some country differences as well as to changes that have taken place.
We found that, for those who had remained on the labour market, poverty rates were by and large following country averages both in the mid 1980s and more recently (around 2005). However, among those who have no earnings, poverty rates are higher among the ‘pre-retirement elderly’ (aged 55 to 64). The effect of employment exit appears to be dependent, in different ways, on what kind of social security system serves as a safety net for the household. Those who can rely on a retirement income are generally better off than those who rely on social insurance benefits, who in turn are better off than those who rely on social assistance. Moreover, the relative income, poverty and inequality among those who are outside paid employment exhibit many differences among the countries considered here. These differences, by and large, follow from the differences in regimes (social policy institutions). High coverage as well as high benefit levels of social insurance programs help to reduce inequality in all three respects mentioned above. When it comes to the inequality outcomes, in the mid-1980s, countries clustered fairly well according to The Three Worlds. More than two decades later, the inequality patterns prevail to an extent that would surprise even regime-dependent scholars. In countries with typically flat-rate benefits, such as Ireland and the UK, poverty rates have risen particularly fast.  
Hence, with regard to ‘sustainability’ the changes over the past decades, by and large, go in the right direction. It has apparently been possible to break the downward trend in labour force participation among men in pre-retirement age, and the underlying trend towards higher participation among women is also pushing up participation rates among women between the ages 55 and 64 in most countries. The picture is less positive when it comes to inequality indicators: in some countries, poverty rates in this age group have seen large increases for those outside employment. Given the ongoing tightening of contribution conditions for old age pensions and considering the qualifying conditions for invalidity benefits in many countries, there appears to be a stratification deficit building up in this exit phase of the economic life cycle. Considering the systematically worse health conditions of women in this age group, there is an obvious gender bias in this process. Still, to judge from the low poverty rates among non-employed pre-retirement elderly in some of the European countries, there appears to be policy instruments available that can deal with the stratification deficits as well, without jeopardising the sustainability deficits. 
Conclusions
A few tentative conclusions follow from our explorations of the data at hand. The first one is the shift in the discursive focus. Economic and demographic challenges for the sustainability of the welfare state have taken the floor and, consequently, decommodification has given way to ‘recommodification’, i.e. how to put people (back) into employment. Countries are looking for means to increase employment among the young, to give better possibilities for mothers to work and to create incentives for the old to continue to work. The regimes struggle with partially the same, partially different problems. Under the Nordic / Social democratic regime, the expansion of state employment in the social service sector not only facilitated female employment but also helped maintaining high employment and equality in more general terms. However, expansion of this kind of employment requires tax funding, and this works as long as it is seen as a deferred wage, otherwise the tax burden will erode competitiveness. What comes out as a very clear issue is the macro-economic constraint stemming from failures to impose wage moderation. Furthermore, from the life-cycle deficit perspective, the crucial point in the Nordic countries is to facilitate school-to-employment entry.  The Central European / Conservative and Southern European regimes face the problem of how to expand female labour-force participation and prolong employment careers. The Liberal regime is wrestling with increased inequalities in incomes as well as labour market conditions. 
Secondly, the notion of ‘Three worlds’ of welfare capitalism is less valid today than a quarter a century ago. This has to do with two different processes. One is that the three 'old' regimes have changed, at least in some respects, due mainly to the modernization of family policy and activation in labour market policy. The other one is that the old world of the 18 OECD countries is changing by extension of the OECD and of the EU. This implies a number of new emerging worlds of welfare capitalism. The ‘Latin rim’ of Southern Europe was first to be labelled, but we argue that the Post-Socialist’ world has increased the variation more, and perhaps it is time to talk about a specific ‘Asian regime’, with South Korea as the clearest case accompanied by Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau (Kwon 2005).
As countries still cluster in regimes, it has motivated the move of the research strategy towards a more variable and program-specific approach (Palme 2006). But here it is important to follow in the footsteps of GEA and analyse the interactions between different programs while looking for institutional complementarities (cf. the ‘Varieties of Capitalism school of thought’, Hall & Soskice 2001). Here the concepts of stratification and sustainability appear to be particularly useful in terms of sorting out different goal dimensions. Moreover, what the recent decades have taught us is that there are good reasons to more explicitly incorporate ethnicity (not only that related to gender but also to immigration) as stratification dimensions (Sainsbury 2012). That economic sustainability is about both labour supply and labour productivity should be fairly straightforward, judging from the - admittedly sketchy - data that we have presented in this paper. The social sustainability of regimes is dependent on how well the regimes combat poverty and inequality, but this may also have feedbacks on the economic sustainability insofar as there are feedbacks on human capital formation (and hence on labour supply and productivity). 
Among the current Worlds of Welfare, our results show remarkable regime differences in how countries are able to deal with both stratification and sustainability over the three different phases in the economic life cycle we studied. Some would argue that this is a consequence of different political preferences in how to deal with the underlying trade-off between stratification and sustainability. We suggest that such an interpretation is the result of an unintended intellectual consequence of the ‘Three Worlds’, that of countries being locked into old regimes unable to learn from others. In contrast to this approach, we argue for a variable approach that could be used for unlocking not only the analysis of welfare state entry-exit patterns but also to inform about a new policy agenda in ageing societies. But then we need to think beyond The Three Worlds and apply its core concepts in a deeper analysis of the current real worlds of welfare capitalism.
We have illustrated how countries differ when it comes to critical phases in the economic life-cycle. The fact that countries differ not only suggests that institutions matter but also that there is room for policy learning. A broader understanding of how welfare, educational and labour market policies work together is an important lesson from The Three Worlds, and we should make good use of that lesson if we want to benefit from ‘best practice’ in research. In the end, the lesson is about designing policies that can foster equality and sustainability simultaneously. What in this context appears as the forgotten dimension of the sustainability of the regimes has to do with its political dimension. This was the central message  of The Three Worlds. In this respect, we would argue that little has changed. The critical issue, which still remains an open question, is how political coalitions can be created and maintained in post-industrial societies.
